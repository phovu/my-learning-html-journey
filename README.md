# My Learning HTML Journey

## Briefly about me. i also hope we share something in common
Hello, my name is Pho and I'm in my sophomore year at the time. I major in Information and Interaction Design at Yonsei. The major itself is a fancy way of saying UI/UX design. Nevertheless, my first and second year of university involved me with other things that actually put an infinite pause to my original plan of learning and maybe mastering in components of designing a web.

I'm incredibly lucky to join Amherst College in Spring 2022. Out of the overabundant resources that the school provided its student with, I discovered a free ticket -- activated by amherst.edu email -- to all courses on my bucketlist. I finally committed to one after hopping in and out of courses because of my fickle nature and my half-hearted determination in learning a thing in computer science.

Imagine you and your besties were bilingual and you guys could speak English as a second language with indetical mother tongue (say, Vietnamese). Sometimes, it is inevitable that you guys may do some code-switching between Vietnamese and English and one of you have to start with something to initiate that conversation's setting.

`<html>` `<html>`
These are the second mandatory tags that come, you know, second to the '!DOCTYPE html' one. It includes all HTML elements.
